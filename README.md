# vscode-vue-sample1 README

This is a code sample for the section "Build a VS Code Extension with Vue.js Using Vue CLI" in this article: [Building a VS Code Extension Using Vue.js](https://www.codemag.com/article/2107071).

The auther does not seem to have left any working code sets for his article, so I have made it.

There are some differences between his article and my code
because I seem to be using a different version of Vue (or Vue CLI?) from his
and also I could not understand everything he is saying.

## Usage
First, install all dependencies.
```shell
npm install
```

Next, open VS Code.
```shell
code .
```

Press F5 to start debugging the extension, and a new VS Code window will open.  
Select "Open Vue App" in the command palette(Ctrl + Shift + p), and then you can see the "Welcome to Your Vue.js App" page in the tab.
